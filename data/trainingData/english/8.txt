The crimson-backed sunbird is an endemic resident breeder in the Western Ghats of India. The peak nesting season is December to March[4] but has been known to nest in nearly all months of the year in the southern Western Ghats. Two eggs are laid in a suspended nest on a thin drooping branch of low tree, fern frond or shrub.[5] Both the male and female take part in nest building with the interior mainly built by the female. The eggs are mainly incubated by the female but males may involve themselves in feeding the young. The incubation period is about 18â€“19 days.[6][7]

These birds are important pollinators of some plant species.[8]

Males establish and defend feeding territories on flower bearing shrubs and trees. Plants such as Helixanthera intermedia which had a lot of nectar were defended more vigorously.[9] Being small birds they may be killed by attack from insects like praying mantises too[10]

Although resident in many areas, they may make altitudinal movements in response to rains. In some areas they move to the foothills during the monsoons and move to the higher regions after the rains.[11][12]
