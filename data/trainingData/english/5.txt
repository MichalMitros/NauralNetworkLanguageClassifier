Mitchell worked for six years in Dallas Theater Center and a year at Encore Theater.

Mitchell had a recurring role as psychiatrist Dr. Kim Legaspi, the first lesbian lover of Dr. Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) during the 2000â€“01 season of TV series ER. She played in the 2000 movie Frequency alongside Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. She also played Angelina Jolie's hairdresser/lover in the movie Gia and had a one-episode role in House M.D. as a patient.

In March 2009, Mitchell was cast in the ABC series V, a remake of the science-fiction television miniseries. Although ABC and Warner Bros. officials told the magazine she was only cast as a guest star, the announcement led to speculation and concern that Mitchell's character would be killed off at the end of Lost's fifth season,[7] which ended on a cliffhanger that left the fate of her character unknown. Mitchell was later named the lead actress on V.[8][9] Mitchell's character was killed off in the premiere of the sixth (and final) season of Lost, but returned for the two-part series finale.

V lasted for one more season, which premiered on January 4, 2011. Mitchell had a guest-starring role on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in 2011 wherein she played June Frye.[10] Mitchell starred in the film, Answers to Nothing in 2011 as Kate. In 2012, she joined the cast of the series Revolution[11] as Rachel Matheson, replacing actress Andrea Roth, with whom Mitchell had worked for one episode on Lost. The series premiered on September 17, 2012,[12] and ended in May 2014. She then recurred as the Snow Queen on the TV fantasy series Once Upon a Time in late 2014.[13]
