In September 2010 the Northern Territory Government held a community conference and design forum seeking input for the proposed development of Weddell, a new satellite city south of Darwin. Emkaytee Airfield is located within the lands allocated for this development, During this conference, a number of options were discussed regarding the future of the airport. Based on preliminary findings, a buffer zone of at least 1.35 km (0.84 mi) at either end of the runway would need to be factored into the design of the city, if the airfield is to be retained as an aviation facility.[7]

The options discussed expanding the airport to become a major general aviation hub and second airport for the Greater Darwin area, using the existing airfield and facilities as part of a business park type development, or removing the airport altogether and relocatinging the Top End Flying Club and other tenants to another airfield in the region. Some work has been undertaken by the Government to reseal the nearby Hughes Airfield, but no formal commitment has been announced for a second airport at this time. A Northern Territory Government spokesman did comment that the preferred runway alignment for such a facility would be 11/29 in a meeting with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in February 2012.[8]
