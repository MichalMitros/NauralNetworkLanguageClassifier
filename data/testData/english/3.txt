One of the 10 poorest countries in the world, Mali's life expectancy at birth is 55 years.[3] Nearly 50% of the population of 16,455,903 is under 14 years of age and Mali has the second highest birth rate in the world,[4] making high maternal and child mortality a national crisis. In Mali, 1 and 5 children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from five treatable, preventable diseases: malaria, diarrhea, acute respiratory tract infections, measles, and malnutrition. The infant mortality rate (death before 1 year of age) is 104.3 deaths/1000 births, the second highest in the world.[4] Only 27% of children under 5 sleep beneath insecticide-treated mosquito nets—one of the most effective ways to treat malaria—and only 34.8% of children under 5 years with fever receive treatment with any type of antimalarial medication.[5]

In 2014, high maternal mortality (1 in 22 women die in childbirth) led Save the Children to rate Mali the 3rd worst country to be a mother in 2014.[6] Only 52% of births among women aged 15–19 are attended by a skilled health professional.[5]

Mali is dependent on international development organizations and foreign missionary groups for much of its health care. The total expenditure on health makes up only 7% of the national GDP and Mali has 0.1 hospital beds per 1,000 people.[4] This health crisis is compounded by high levels of poverty—over 50% of the population lives on less than $1 a day (PPP)[7]—and low levels of literacy, with a literacy rate of 39%.[4]
